/*
d_functional_compose_new
  Creates a heap-allocated composed transformer that applies two transformers
in sequence: first (g), then second (f), implementing f(g(x)).
  Allocates an internal temporary buffer of _temp_size bytes for the
intermediate result.

Parameter(s):
  _first:     the transformer to apply first (g).
  _context1:  context forwarded to _first; may be NULL.
  _second:    the transformer to apply second (f).
  _context2:  context forwarded to _second; may be NULL.
  _temp_size: size in bytes of the intermediate result between _first and
              _second.
Return:
  A pointer to a newly allocated d_composed_transformer, or NULL if _first
was NULL, _second was NULL, _temp_size was 0, or allocation failed.

d_functional_compose_apply
  Applies a composed transformer to an input, writing the final result to
_output. Internally applies the first transformer to _input, stores the
intermediate result in the composed transformer's temporary buffer, then
applies the second transformer to produce _output.

Parameter(s):
  _composed: pointer to the composed transformer.
  _input:    pointer to the input element.
  _output:   pointer to the output destination.
Return:
  A boolean value corresponding to either:
  - true, if both transformations succeeded, or
  - false, if _composed was NULL, any internal pointer was NULL, or either
    transformation failed.
